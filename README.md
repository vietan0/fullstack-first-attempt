# Fullstack App - First Attempt

### Method:

- Create two folders `client` and `server`

- With `server`:
  - Install `express`
  - Set up `app.get('/api', ...)` to serve data
- With `client`:
  - Use `vite` to initialize React project
  - `fetch('/api')` to get data

- Install `concurrently` to `npm run dev` both `client` and `server`

### Congratulations, you just became a fullstack developer!
